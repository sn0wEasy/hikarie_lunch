What surprised me was that most of the people there were foreigners. Is it in some guidebook?\n\nI sat at the counter, but there was a sign prohibiting photography. There are quite a few photos on Tabelog, but has the system changed recently? ``Blend'' (900 yen) is my favorite type with a strong sour taste. I'm also happy that there's a lot in the cup.\n\nAlso, the best part of being at the counter is being able to look at the cups lined up on the wall. Sweets such as chiffon cake seemed to be popular.",
